    <h1>Forensics: The Craft of Asking Good Questions</h1>
    <h4>August 16, 2015</h4>
    <article>
      <p>
        Hey there folks! In the vein of my recent cultural post, I want to talk about a skill that expands out of the realm of programming and into life: how to ask good questions. It's been called an "art" by some, but in my mind it's more of a craft - something that can be hones, worked at, and practiced. It's not a skill anyone is born with (after all, who knows how to speak when they're born), but rather grown through experience. At both DBC and my previous position as a writing tutor, I've seen people who need help - however they have trouble getting it, because they don't know what to ask for. Worse, I've seen people who want help, and people who are eager to give it - however they can't connect, because, again, they don't know how to ask for the right kind of help. Getting help is a delicate balance - you want just enough direction to be able to achieve your goals on your own. If you are told too much, you're just getting the problem solved for you, and you'll never learned. If you get nothing, you're not far off from where you started - lost and wandering in the woods. So how do we solve this? By asking good questions. Then, you're saying, how do we do that?
      </p>
      <p>
        First, the first (and maybe most) important skill in asking questions is knowing <em>when</em> to ask a question. It's important to have some idea of what you want to know - simply saying "I don't know how to do this, where do I start" is too much to answer effectively. It's best to ask questions only when you've exhausted your personal resources - that is, when you know the limits of your own knowledge and abilities. Even once you've reached this point, don't ask questions yet! First, try something - maybe something you're familiar with but not confident in, or maybe something totally new to you. You may find that you're capable beyond what you've thought! You may try something that actually works, and voila! You've answered your own question.
      </p>
      <p>
        But on the sad (and frequent) occasion that simply trying a new strategy or two doesn't work, your initial legwork has given you a solid foundation from which to ask a great question. You've managed to pinpoint the problem, and you know what <em>doesn't</em> work - you're already narrowing the scope in which the question can be answered, which allows you to digest and implement the answer more easily. It makes whoever you ask for help start off easier - they know what you know and what you don't know, and won't suggest everything which you've already tried. So tell them exactly that! Tell them, "I'm not sure, but I think this is what the problem is. I tried fixing it with X, but that didn't work, and neither did Y - got any ideas?" With a question like this, it's a lot easier to get on your level - to see the problem for your eyes, and to integrate your perception of the problem with the possible solutions your generous benefactor may think up.
      </p>

        Once you've effectively framed the question - that is, presented it in its most specific form, presented a couple strategies for attacking it, and positing theories that might help someone more experienced - you can expect to recieve help which is a lot more, well, helpful. At this point, remember that every conversation (even asking for help) is a two-way street. Listen to what you're being told! For some, it can help to try to translate it into their own mind, to treat the solution as if it grew out of their own mental processes. For others, open ears are enough - it's important to really take it in, because the full answer may not come in one burst. You ask, what do you mean? I mean that sometimes an answer doesn't solve the whole problem, but does provide a step forward. So take that answer in, work it into your own solution, and ask a follow-up! Most people who are willing to answer your question in the first place will be willing to answer another - especially if they genuinely want to see you succeed. So take advantage of this! Use what you're being told to build to a new understanding, and then take the lay of the land again - is there anything else you're still confused about? If so, follow up with it! Repeat the process again, and get even more specific. Sometimes just nailing down the right question to ask will provide the answer!
      </p>
      <p>
        Asking the right question is a gradual process - it takes time to develop the right question to ask, time to listen to and interpret the answer, and time to ask follow-ups and repeat the process if needed. But if you never seem to get the right sort of help, it's more than worth your while to develop this skill. Especially in DBC, where we are all learning together, we are all reliant on each other to help each other out and lift each other up. Sometimes we just have to know how to help - and asking the right questions can get us there!
