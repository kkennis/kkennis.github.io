    <h1>Are You Experienced? Your Time at DBC</h1>

        Whatup! It's my first week of Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp, and it's pretty crazy. I know a ton I never would have imagined knowing before coming here - specifically, how to use the command line. But I'm here now, and very much looking forward to what's to come. As I see it - and from our first week's reading material - DBC is a whole body experience. It's part of what about DBC appealed to me when comparing it with other bootcamps - it's not just a technical school, it's somewhere where you can learn how to think, meet people, and develop techniques to increase your productivity in your life and future career. It's awesome! And for anyone who's reading - DBC alumnus, staff, student, or prospect - I highly recommend checking out the meditation resources and going for it. Considering how easy it is and the benefits is has on your life, the practice of meditation is like a real-life cheat code, and I love that DBC also emphasized it right off the bat.

        Beyond the Phase 0 materials and Shareef's fireside chat, I was also able to tour DBC SF with Andrew Fitch, which was an enlightening my experience. So now, I feel like I've learned about DBC in all the possible modes - reading about it, listening to people talk about it, seeing it in person, and now doing it, as part of Phase 0. I think for me the in-person tour was the coolest - I got to see the office in action, and it was so cool to see people actually working together on their projects, to see personal and career counsels giving hands-on support to students, and seeing all of the resources available to students and alumni - not to mention the chill yet productive general vibe. For any fellow Phase 0 students who are local, I highly recommend taking the tour - you'll be even more excited to get on site.

        As far as how I fit into this culture, I think the tour in general helped solidify my feeling that I'll fit right in. It was cool to see the diverse backgrounds of people coming in, whether it be age, level of education, work experience, and background in programming. Everybody seemed to be having fun, and that is my number one priority each and every day. I'm excited to grind too, because even 10 hours a day isn't that much when you're having fun. It was also great to hop into the intro session with Alex and see that I'll be with some fellow sports fans - especially as a Bay Area native, there's a lot to talk about in sports these days (Go Warriors!). I would love to engage my cohort (and others, why not) in off-campus activites as well.A couple other students in the intro session and I connected on our love of the outdoors, and for anyone who loves hiking/camping/fishing/being in the bosom of Nature, I'm so down to figure out some DBC trips where we can all get to know each other a little more.

        All in all, I'm hugely excited to get to DBC. I'm excited to meet people, get to know them, and build things with them. I'm excited to learn how to work long hours and take on big projects. I'm excited to meet people in industry and build a network of other tech junkies. I'm excited to wake up in the woods with some fellow bootcampers and have a barbeque. And, finally, I'm excited to work on a big project with a team, and at the end be able to tell people "We made this." Thanks to DBC, I can see it in my grasp.
