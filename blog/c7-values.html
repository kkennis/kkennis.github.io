    <h1>Being Open</h1>
    <h4>July 30, 2015</h4>

        Hey readers! Today we're talking culture - in tech, and in the world in general. We talked last week about the dangers of stereotype threat, and today I want to talk about one of the key tools in the battle against its dangers. In particular, I want to talk about the personal value of openness.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do I mean by openness? I mean being willing to talk about what's going on with you. Not just what's happening, but how you feel about it - how you <em>really</em> feel. This is hard, and often counterintuitive - we're socially conditioned to try to fit in with the rest, but our inner feeling don't always do that. In my opinion, a lot of those unexpressed feelings are your <em>real</em> personality - and to better know yourself and come into your own, you have to learn how to express them. A big part of this is learning to be vulnerable with others, even complete strangers. While it may seem a little intimidating to feel like you can tell anything to anyone, coming to this point is a sign that you are no longer tempering the flow between thougth and action. That's openness - by bringing others into your inner life, you make your own inner life more whole. Other people are your greatest resource, and openness is how you tap into them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having worked as a tutor, I'm used to giving advice, and encouraging openness is built-in to almost every type of advice I give. Especially in a learning scenario (the same in which stereotype threat looms), it can hard to admit that you don't know something, or that you aren't good at something. A lot of my work went to making people comfortable, to putting people in a situation where they felt like they could admit their vulnerabilities without reputational risk. To do this, I asked questions, tried to make them laugh, and made it clear that no matter what, I was on their team. When these students managed to open up, it <em>always</em> worked - not only did it allow us to talk openly and make real improvements when it came to their writing, it made the students happier and allowed them to have fun in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        How many times has something you didn't want to tell people really weighed on you? I'm sure it's happened to everybody once - as much as I try to adhere to the value of openness, it's happened - and still happens - to me, and it's not fun. No matter how much I felt like I might be ashamed to share something, I was always wrong, and the moment you vocalize something internal, the anxiety seems to just melt away. It's really an incredible experience, to discover that you really can tell anybody anything - as long as you mean it, and you stand behind it. If this seems like a big ask (and it is to many), try it with your friends first. They're your friends - you can tell them whatever you want, and they'll support you. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In this ways, openness is a key tool in both meeting new people and strengthening the relationships you already have. But beyond your "real life," it can also help your internal experience - it can make you see the world as not so different from what's inside you. I love to think that your inner world is a mirror of the outer one - for every Everest and Marianas Trench in the world, there's one in your mind, and it's as fertile and full of potential as the one you see before you. Openness only strenghtens this mirroring, and it has real effects on the way you see the world. If you share yourself with the world and voluntarily put yourself out there, you have nothing to hide - so nothing to be ashamed of. For these reasons, openness is not only important, but absolutely essential, to personal happiness and living with flow in the world as it is. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In these same ways, openness can be used to combat stereotype threat. When you feel like you're facing it, openness yourself up - envelop the situation within your own thought and understanding. There may be a stereotype associated with some part of your social identity - get out in front of it, instead of letting it eat away at you. Acknowledge it, and be honest with yourself about the ways in which you both perpetuate and break the stereotype. When you know who <em>you</em> are - not what the stereotype says - the threat ceases to be a threat. Instead, it is an opportunity to break the mold, to do your own part in breaking down stereotypes. It all comes down to recognizing the threat, and realizing that it has no power over you - because you're you, not your stereotype.
