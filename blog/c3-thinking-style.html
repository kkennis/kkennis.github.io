    <h1>How Do You Think? A Metacognitive Journey</h1>
    <h4>June 28, 2015</h4>

      <p>
        Have you ever thought about how you think? Try it sometime! It's called metacognition, and the process of thinking about thinking can help you better harness your mental energy and become a better and more productive learning. Everybody has a specific style of thinking, and discovering how you think can give you a better picture of the most productive environents to you. For instance, some people prefer to tackle a problem linearly, step-by-step - however, some people think of a problem in chunks, going from the last steps, to the middle, and back and forth. Some people are more inclined to thinking about what is in front of them - these conerete thinkers are more concerned with the world "as it is," but others often think about the world as it could be. Concrete or abstract, sequential or random: which are you?

        From taking this <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">quiz</a>, I've found out a little bit about my own thinking style. Check out my thinking style graph: based on the four main thinking styles (Concrete Sequential, Concrete Random, Abstract Sequential, Abstract Random), I show a pretty interesting tendency: my strongest styles are Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential. Abstract Random wasn't far behind, and the only one I don't show a tendency towards is Concrete Sequential (I guess it's too straightforward!). So I would say, based on my own research, that I'm more of a random thinker - however, when I want to engage with abstract concepts, I also think of them sequentially in order to "pragmatize" them.

        This page on <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Mind Styles</a> gives insight into the behavioral characteristics of each thinking style. One thing that I took a look at were the challenges for each of my dominant thinking styles, and it helped me think about what I might need to be aware of as I start to enter a more work-intensive environment. A couple of the "abstract sequential" challenges I took issue with: it is claimed that it is hard for those thinkers to "not monopolize a conversation," which is something I never thought I did. May need to be more aware of that now! A couple things I definitely agree with: it's often challenging for me to have an excessive amount of rules: I'd rather be able to solve a problem my own way. In essence, when working I like being told what to do, but not how to do it. Furthermore, the page on mind styles states that a common challenge of concrete random thinkers is "re-doing anything once it's done," and I definitely identify with that. I was always the person in school who turned in their essay the minute it was done without any proofreading, and I think this habit may become dangerous in a work context. This is definitely something I've learned about my thinking style, and something I want to improve.

        Already, I've used the different thinking styles to create a ledger of behavioral tendencies to watch out for, and tendencies to seek and encourage. I think random thinking is really useful for me, as I love to work backwards to solve problems, and I want to hone that skill. However, I also want to be able to explain my thinking process, a characteristic of sequential thinkers. Since none of these styles is the outright "best," I think it's important to realize that there are occasions and projects where each thinking style has its advantages. By being able to employ more thinking styles, we open ourselves up to new ways of learning, which I think is the most important thing. This, in particular, relates to Carol Dweck's research on the growth mindset; it is imperative for all of us to be aware of the constant possibility of self-improvement. A growth mindset - the mindset that intelligence and aptitude are products of nurture rather than nature - has been proven to promote that growth itself! It's true: just believing that you can improve makes you more likely to, and those that believe they can improve will always find opportunities to evolve and learn new things. With this in mind, and a grasp on the way you think and learn, you have a toolset to improve yourself productively and effectively. Now the only thing left is to do it!
