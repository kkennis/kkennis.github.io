    <h1>Making a Choice: My Experience with Conflict</h1>
    <h4>August 6, 2015</h4>
    <article>
    <p>
        Hi friends! In the vein of my recent culturally-focused blog posts, I want to go forward with talking about strategies for managing stress and conflict in DBC, work, and life. Everybody has dealt with conflict in their life - sometimes it's really painful, but at other times, conflict can be the driving force towards new heights and maturity. I'm lucky enough to know this first-hand - one of the major decisions I've made in my life only came about after much internal conflict, but having made it in the face of such conflict, it's put me down a path from which I've never looked back.
      </p>
      <p>
        In high school, I was a decent student - not bad, not great. When college applications rolled around, I hoped to go to either UCLA or Cal, but did not get into either. I was, however, lucky enough to be accepted into New York University - a school I'd applied to mostly out of curiosity. This was such a drastic switch in my expectations and opportunities I decided to go for it - after some debating with my parents (another conflict, but not a major one), I packed my bags and left California to live alone in New York City, at the tender age of 17.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, it was awesome - I was alone in one of the most dynamic cities in the world, I was meeting new people every day, and there so many things to do and see my head was spinning. The atmosphere, the activity, and the novelty of everything made those first few weeks pretty incredible. However, after a while, it started to grate on me. Coming from California - a big factor was the weather - I still complain to friends in New York about the process of going outside - the layering up of clothes like you're going off to battle against the elements. I remember one winter morning, tired, rushing to class, the wind whistling down cavernous Broadway, my ears feeling like they were frozen solid, clutching a steaming bagel as my only source of warmth, thinking to myself, "What the hell is all this?" But at first, I could tolerate it - the lifestyle made up for everything. But soon enough, that started to grate too. I grew up spoiled in California - there was plenty of time to relax, I lived an easy-going life, and looooooved getting away into nature. There was none of that in New York. From my perception, it was rush, rush, rush - everybody trying to do a million things, and the worst, the feeling that if you take a second to just relax and do nothing (which I need every once in a while), you're falling behind.

        I made some good friends there, and really enjoyed my time with them - but I couldn't seem to sink into a groove. More and more, I wanted to get away - time and time again, I found myself browsing the wikipedia articles for national parks across the US. There was absolutely no nature there - and to any New Yorkers who may be reading this, Central Park isn't nature! In the end, I think the way of life in the city got to me - it was a little too much. I was way to wound up in my head, way too worried about the things I was trying to do, and altogether taking myself way too seriously. And when I got the chance to go back home, I realized how far this had developed. My parents commented on me always seeming like I was in a rush, being short and brusque with people, and generally being more stressed out. I realized it was true - New York had changed me for the worse. I decided that, for lack of a better term, I wanted to take it easy. So I started thinking: now that I know this about myself, how do I handle New York?

      <p>
        This, here, is where the conflict arose. I went back to New York to finish out the semester, and found myself actively counting the days until I could return to California. I thought to myself, do I really want to do this for four years? Do I want to graduate from NYU, have all my contacts be in New York, probably stay there to work, and be stuck in the rat race for god knows how long? I knew that my answer was no - but I didn't know what to do about it. Transfer was the obvious option - but coming to grips with making that decision was where I really faced an internal conflict. I asked myself: if I left NYU, was I giving up? I felt a little ashamed - everybody always said, "If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere," and here I was admitting to myself that I couldn't make it in New York. NYU had one of the lowest freshman retention rates in the country - was I to fall to that level too? Should I just stick throught it and complain constantly, like everybody else in New York does? And if I did decide to leave, what would I do? If I wanted to transfer into a UC, I had to transfer in as a junior - but I'd only done one year. How would I reconcile that? If I go to community college, would I be taking a step back? All these questions, and more, raced through my head for the rest of the semester - I like to say now that they were the last grip of stress that NYC had on me.

        Because, in the end, I did decide to leave - shame, perception, and worrying about the future be damned. I just couldn't do it - California was such home for me, and New York so foreign and hard to adapt to. And once I did decide, telling myself, "Once I leave, I'm just not going back," it took me a while before I told anyone else. I told a couple close friends, and otherwise talked about it in passing, like it was something I was maybe considering, when in reality the decision was made. I had to work up the courage to tell my parents - that hey, I fought a little with you guys to let me go to NYU, but as it turns out, I don't want to stay. But once I did - and, being awesome parents, they were very understanding - it was like I was free. I didn't have to go back! Upon realizing this, I exhaled about a year's worth of bad energy. It hurt a little to tell my friends in the city that I wouldn't be back, but not nearly as much as it would have hurt my inner self to spend another year (or three) there. I knew this was a big life decision, and a risk - I was pretty adamant about going to either UCLA or Cal, and getting in was no sure deal, but it felt so so good to know that I was resetting with California as my home base, and all my inner conflict seemed to wash away.
      </p>

        And as I've mentioned in the introduction, this was one of the best decisions of my life. I did go to community college, and it wasn't so bad! I had a lot of friends in the area, including some who had transferred themselves, and I got the chance to work part-time in commercial real estate in San Francisco's Financial District. I grew a lot in that year. I enjoyed my time at College of Marin too - it was close to home, and I like to tell people - with a wink and a nod of course - that I got my GEs done the easy way (although COM wasn't even that easy). I worked hard, and was lucky enough to be accepted to UCLA, which I now see as pretty much the best university in the world. I loved, loved, loved my time at UCLA, made lifelong friends, lived a more typical college experience (student neighborhoods, football games, and actual campus), and graduated with an awesome degree. I'm so happy I got to graduate from there.

        And as I look back, I realize that where I am now - and it's exactly where I want to be - would have never happened without the entire experience. So, if I could do it again, I wouldn't change a thing. I don't regret going to NYU - I got to know New York, and made some friends there, and I still enjoy going back and visiting (for a week at the most - any more, and all the stress comes back). Community college was also an awesome experience, as it both helped me get to NYU and gave me the time and opportunity to have my first taste of a business environment on my off-days. And UCLA, as I've said, was everything the college experience should be and more. I'm comfortable with my decision now, and don't have too much trouble explaining it - a very, very frequent question I get is "why did you leave NYU?," and I feel like I can answer now without any sort of regret or shame. New York just isn't me - I'm a relaxed guy, and I need space - mental space, and physical space sometimes too. I need to be able to feel like I can escape if I need to. I don't need to live life in the fast lane, and when it comes to friendships, would prefer to cooperate over compete. In my time at UCLA, I got to know that city too, so now I can say I've lived in three of the most sought-after cities to live in in the world - and with that experience, I know California is the place for me. I want to travel the world, but I don't want to live anywhere else - and this conflict of realizing I wanted to leave NYU gave me that. Before I was telling myself, "Can I not make it?" but now, I'm so, so glad I couldn't make it in New York - and wouldn't have it any other way.
