    <h1>Feedback: DBC's True Gift</h1>
    <h4>July 15, 2015</h4>

      <p>
        Hello again! Today I want to turn the lens from the tech world back to my own experience. Specifically, I want to talk about one aspect of DBC that has been huge to both my technical and cultural growth over the past few weeks: pair programming. For the unfamiliar, pair programming is exactly that - you and one other person, working together on the same code. Each pair has a driver and a navigator, with their own responsibilities. Think of it like rally car racing - while racing isn't as exciting as programming, there's a few key parallels. In both situations, the driver is doing just that - he's got his hands on the wheel, or his fingers on the keyboard, and he or she is the one executing the pair's ideas. The navigator is the spotter - calling out turns, suggesting strategies, or, in coding, developing logic and organizing the top-down flow of how the code operates. Throughout the course of a project, the pair often switches roles - however, both hugely important, with the navigator more strategy-oriented and the driver more tactically focused. Besides the driver and navigator, there is one more key to the pair programming experience, the straw the stirs the drink: constant communication.

        I'd never done pair programming before DBC in any formal context. I'd looked at other people's code at UCLA, and others had looked at mine, but I'd never before turned in a single piece of code which I was both joint and severally responsible for. However, I have done a lot of one-on-one learning, although mainly from the "navigator" role - I was a writing tutor in college, although our m.o. was not to tell students how to improve but to "navigate" them towards strategies they could then take away from our tutoring sessions. So, being able in pair programming to both do this and learn from others in the process, I was excited! I love to talk, as well, so that didn't hurt.

        So far, pairing has been an unequivocally awesome experience. I've met some cool people, and not just from my cohort, but from across the country. It's great to see that I'm not in it alone, and to be able to talk and compare my experiences with other aspiring software engineers. I admit, that's my favorite part - not the coding, just the getting to know my fellow students. I just love, love, love meeting new people, and every time I pair I have a great conversation and learn something new! So that's what I really look forward to - the beginning and end of sessions, where we get to know each other and where we're all coming from. I get the feeling that during pairing I ask more personal questions than most, but I wouldn't have it any other way. First, being remote, just seeing my pair's face inspires so much curiosity about who that person is! I can't resist asking people where they are from, what their prior programming experience is, whether they've been to San Francisco before, and it seems like a million other things. One thing that did surprise me was the spread of the San Francisco cohort - being local, I had kind of thought that most of our cohort would be local to the Bay Area. But already I've paired with 3 cohort-mates who are currently living outside the US! That's awesome, and it's even more awesome that they're coming to San Francisco, my hometown and a city of unique charm, just for DBC. I hope some of them stay!

        Besides getting to know people, pair programming has been huge in me getting to know myself - my skill level, working habits, etc. I've always been huge on asking people for feedback, and DBC has the built right into the structure of our assignments - so it's been really cool to go on Socrates and see what people thought of our sessions. So far, my feedback has been great! That makes me really happy, since I try really hard to be a positive both culturally and technically. One thing that a couple of my pairs have noted, and that makes me particularly proud, is that I was able to cultivate a fun yet focused atmosphere. This was one of the things I tried to develop at my job as a writing tutor - it's so much easier to learn if you're having fun doing it. Especially when it comes to essays, sometimes students get prompts that they just hate, and the stress induced by an unattractive prompt is really what gets in the way of their writing. Additionally, many of the students who came in for help at UCLA were international students. I really felt for these people - they were thousands of miles away from home, working in a language that oftentimes they'd only known for a few years, and just so, so focused on grades and scores. I think just being there to make them laugh helped ease a lot of the stress they were feeling about their entire student experience, and when people told me that I just helped them feel more at ease at UCLA, that was the greatest reward I could achieve for my work. After all, it's easier to work when you're laughing and having fun, and I'm really happy these skills have translated to DBC. I think that if there's something you gotta do, it goes most smoothly if you make it fun, so I've tried to bring that attitude to every pair programming session, and I'm glad that based on my feedback, it's working.

        And while my feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, there is room for improvement. The one critical piece of feedback I've received reads as follows: "I loved how productive and efficient our session was. It would be great, however, if you don't always present the ready solution right away but check in more with your pair and let your pair evolve their ideas, even if it takes a bit longer." This is one I've taken to heart, and really tried to act on. I've come from a programming background (as well as studying math in college) so developing logical structure is a skill I've developed over the years - however, a lot of us are not coming from that hard-data background. In the pairing sessions since I've receieved that feedback, I've tried to identify with those who are newer to programming. In the words of D.T. Suzuki, the zen mind is the beginner's mind, and I think that maxim applies here - sometimes, rushing through a problem really quick, even if you can do it, leads you to miss some of the finer points of logic and structural underpinnings. So I've really made an effort to be more patient, and when I do know the answer and am navigating, to try to "lead my pair to water." I would hope someone would do the same for me, so it's only right for my part as well.

        As far as writing feedback goes, I've been having a lot of fun with that too! Although I have found that most of my feedback is culturally-oriented instead of techincally oriented. I haven't found it hard to be kind, since everyone's so cool and always puts forth their best effort, but for the same reasons I have trouble sometimes finding something actionable to say. A lot of the time I just want to write: "as far as actionable feedback goes, keep doing what you're doing!" But I've tried to maybe find a little thing that everyone could improve - some people might see that as nit picking, but I see it as putting icing on the cake. I do think that a lot of the time I make references to things that are so specific that I'm no longer anonymous, but as I think about it now, I think I secretly may be doing it on purpose. I would have no problem standing behind any of my feedback, even when it's critical. I think that's another important skill, and one I also developed when tutoring - you have to be able to look someone in the eye and tell them that they're doing something wrong, as long as you tell them why it's wrong and how to fix it. I also think non-anonymous feedback could create more of a dialogue, which only further accelerates learning. When it comes to these things, I always flip the script and think about what I would want - and if I was looking to improve, I would want someone to tell me if I was making mistakes. We're all in it together, and I think it's important to re-iterate that too! We're all in together, and as part of our learning experience, it's important to cultivate room for honest feedback, without fear of reputational risk for either the giver or receiver. DBC's got an awesome system in place for that, and culturally I love how integrated feedback is into our development as aspiring software engineers.
