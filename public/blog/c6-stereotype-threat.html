    <h1>The Crab in the Bucket: The Dangers of Stereotype Threat</h1>
    <h4>July 24, 2015</h4>
    <article>
      <p>
        One of the unfortunate paradigms of this world is stereotyping. Borne out of evolutionary psychology (the exploration of this is worth another blog post), stereotypes have been shown to have adverse effects on the identity, psychology, and academic and career success of those who suffer from them. What is most dangerous is that stereotypes can be attached to so many things - race, gender, appearance, sexuality, even type of hair - and members of those groups are forced by society to interact with those stereotypes. Some members of stereotyped groups work to escape those stereotypes, some embrace them, and some try to ignore them. All of them, however, suffer from stereotype threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        First explored and defined by Claude Steele, stereotype threat is the idea that stereotypes about a group can adversely affect all members of that group, even those who do not conform to a given stereotype. When an expectation is placed on one based on an aspect of their social identity, that expectation can be extremely hard to escape. As Steele describes, stereotype threat can potentially lead to self-sabotage - in standardized testing, for instance, when a student is made aware of a pertinent negative stereotype (such as by stating their race on test forms before taking the test, or being told that the test will measure their intellectual ability), that stereotype often affects the student to a point where they cannot perform to their normal ability. This creates a vicious cycle: stereotype threat results in poor performance, which in turn perpetuates those same stereotypes. This is seen across many domains for many social groups, and affects the academic, business, and socioeconomic spheres to surprising extents.

        I have been extremely fortunate in my life - I do not think I have ever been a serious victim of stereotype threat. Being on the majority side of most major demographics (I'm a white, financially-comfortable, straight, brown-haired, average-looking male) helps with that, and I've been raised in taught in such a way as to have a thick skin when it comes to outside judgment, whether those judgments are sterotypes or not. But while I have not consciously suffered from stereotype threat, I have been close to those who have.

        In my time at UCLA, I had the opportunity to volunteer with LA Moneythink, an incredible organization which teaches weekly personal finance classes in underserved communities across Los Angeles. As part of my teaching, I worked with students in these schools whose self-expectation was alarmingly low. Most children in these schools are <em>constantly</em> being told they can't succeed, sometimes, I'm sorry to say, even by their own teachers and parents. Financial constraints and the disorganized Los Angeles Unified School District didn't help the problem - for one class I taught, the district could not afford to staff a certified teacher, and instead the class was taught by uncertified substitutes who were legally allowed to work for at most a month at a time. There was no contintuity, little learning, and unsurprisingly, a commensurate sense of resignation among the students. All in all, this and other classrooms I visited were environments that were extremely unconducive to success.

        These students, with the cards stacked against them in such a way, are serious victims of stereotype threat - nearly every aspect of their environment was reinforcing self-perceptions of stereotypes. At Moneythink, we did what we could to break that - one of the goals of our mission, and the focus of many of our lessons, was simply telling these students that college <em>is</em> an option. And it was heartbreaking to see how many of our students had literally never been told that before. When we tried to explain the benefits and opportunities of higher education, most of the time it didn't take - we were college students, barely adults ourselves, and could only see them once a week, and were a drop in an ocean whose current was pulling the opposite way.

        But how could these students be realistically expected to listen when we were one voice, not even from their area, standing against a mountain of other influences? These students, on the whole, were convinced in theory ("Sure, I want to go to college..."), but not in practice ("...but I'll never get there."). This is stereotype threat - the belief that, despite your goals, you are not meant to achieve them because of the group you belong to, and the fact that that doubt itself is actively preventing them. It's a real thing, and it's absolutely heartbreaking. This doubt can turn into fear and hostility, and manifest itself in self-perpetuating ways: journalist Ron Suskind, in his book <em>A Hope in the Unseen</em>, describes the "crab in a bucket" mentality of inner city students: "When one crab tries to climb from a bucket, the others pull it back down." In this way, students who try to combat stereotypes can become victims of ridicule and hostility from their peers, only strengthening the threat of the stereotype.

        So what can we do? There's no such thing as upheaving the entire social and educational order in one go: streotype threat cannot be toppled, it must be chipped away at. At Moneythink, we had a lot of little victories - a student who liked to ignore us or act out asking a serious question, students actively participating in the mock job interviews and other activities we developed, even just getting a class to be quiet and listen (which is the first step) when we were explaining a concept. And there were success stories - Mike, a sophomore at Birmingham Community Charter High School, took the time to really understand what we were talking about when it came to personal finance, and went out of his way to ask us about the college application process. He expressed his plan to me of becoming a mechanical engineer, and I have full faith he is following through with that. At the Moneythink National Conference I attended, I met a former mentee named Jeremiah from the South Side of Chicago - he had just received a scholarship to Dartmouth. Cedric Jennings, the student profiled in <em>A Hope in the Unseen</em>, made it from Ballou High School, one of the poorest-performing high schools in Washington, DC, to Brown University. These students' stories are rays of hope, and are proof that the threats of stereotypes need not be overwhelming. But it is also important to remember that for them, and millions of others, their struggle is never really over: there will always be those in society who perpetuate stereotypes. So, reader, I encourage you to be on the other team, cut through streotypes and see people for who they really are, and appreciate what many have achieved in the face of these threats. If you want to reduce the social power of stereotype threat, person-to-person interaction is <em>the</em> most important thing. If you are reading this, I implore you to make a concerted effort to forget the stereotypes that may come to mind when you meet a new person - if this is too much, take pleasure when you're proven wrong (because you will be). We, as a society, need to do all we can to work against stereotype threat and give all groups an equal opportunity to succeed. It's an ongoing battle, and it's up to you to play your part.
