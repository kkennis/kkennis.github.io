    <h1>Margin, Border, and Padding: The ins, outs, and what-have-yous</h1>

        Hello my people! I'm writing in right now from Savannah, Georgia - the first southern city I've visited, and a lovely town of rivers, parks, and great nightlife. I have to mention that yesterday I was happy witness to the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Kyle Kent - you probably don't know them, but you should. It was awesome, and now I'm beating the heat (95 and humid - Californians, it gives new meaning to the word "debilitating") by writing this blog post.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's talk about a very important concept to HTML CSS: the box model. Every HTML element, whether a div, table, or even an anchor (link, for the uninitiated), comes in a box. You may not see it, but it's always there - it's the border which defines the space your element takes up on the page. Every box has content - maybe text, an image, or even just a solid colored background. No matter what, there's something in the box - otherwise, it wouldn't make sense being on your page! The notion that boxes hold content is pretty obvious, but that's not the whole story. I'm here to tell you that in fact, boxes hold <em>more</em> than content.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what does a box have besides content? Three very important position elements: margin, border, and padding. Let's start with border, since the name speaks for itself. In simple terms, the border is the edge of the box you are working with. Borders can come in different thicknesses, styles, and colors, all possible through CSS. Note that the border does not have to be visible: by giving the border property a "0" value or setting it to the same color of your background, you can have an invisible border. Note that the border contributes to the dimensions of the box; so in the case of the invisible border, the two options we have are <em>not</em> the same - the second option actually increases the size of your box by the size of the border - double that, actually. A little handy math if you need it - a 1 pixel border will add one pixel to the bottom and top of the border, increasing it's height by 2 pixels. Same goes for width.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's the border then, telling you exactly where your box ends. But the mighty border is surrounded on both sides by two other sometimes confounding properties: margin and padding. Again, the term "margin" is probably more intuitive to the layman or laywoman, so let's continue there. Sometiemes, when we are using a lot of different elements (especially block elements), we don't want them butting up each other. Just like you might appreciate not sharing a wall with the house next door, sometimes our elements need a little space. This is what margin is for: it defines a space outside the border which other elements cannot occupy. Margin, then, is that alley between buildings, giving everything a little space to breathe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Padding, then, is the bizarro cousin of margin. Whereas margin gives elements a little room on the outside, padding makes some space inside, creating room between the border and the enclosed content. A house's walls aren't paper thin - they need a little insulation, and content needs a little room so it doesn't run into the border (which looks really ugly). Note that padding is considered part of the element, so it doesn't affect its size - what it does affect is the size of the space content can take up. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So, to recap: every element has a border, padding adds space <em>inside</em> between the border and the content, and margin adds space <em>outside</em> between the border and the big ol' world of surrouding elements on the page. Margin, border and padding are the secrets to turning a cluttered-looking page into something smooth, sleek and mordern, and if you think your site could be improved, add a little space! Also note that these properties can be changed on individual sides as well. For instance, margin-top will affect the margin on top, padding-left add padding on the left, and so on. I hope this was helpful - go forth and make an awesome website!
