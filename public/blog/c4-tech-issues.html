    <h1>The Name Game: Internet Security and the DNS</h1>

        Dear Internet User:
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a brave new world out here, in the new Wild West. The Internet truly is a land of opportunity; you can create and share whatever you'd like, and there's unlimited real estate, to boot. All you need to stake your claim is a domain name: just build it, and they will come. But how do people know where to find you - and more to the point, behind the fog of a computer network, how do people know you're really you?
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the cornerstone innovations that made the Internet what it is today is the Domain Name System, or the DNS. The DNS is a registry that maps IP addresses (the unique numeric identifier of a webpage's host machine) to URLs (Uniform resource locators - what you type into the address bar to navigate to a site, as in <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>). So, just like the real world, we have two ways of identifying a place. IP addresses are like latitude and longitude - precise, but hard to digest and keep track of. URLs, on the other hand, are like the names for a place, and are much easier to remember, giving us a better way to "know where to go." Just like it's awesome that we don't have to say 37.7833° N, 122.4167° W but rather just San Francisco, accessing a website through name instead of IP address makes the Web a lot easier to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, a story: wouldn't it be strange if some small remote city started calling itself San Francisco, advertised itself to tourists as the real San Francisco, and then robbed every tourist that made their way over there? That's pretty farfetched - but it's exactly what often happens on the Internet. Unfortunately, there are many sites out there that masquerade as banks, financial companies, e-commerce sites, and other transactional services, waiting for you to be taken in, enter your personal information on their site, and have your identity stolen. But thankfully, there are also forces of good on the Web, and over the years a protocol of Internet security has developed. Most large websites these days operate on HTTPS - a secure version of HTTP that relies on authentication keys to confirm the identity and trustworthiness of the server that is sending you data.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, the Internet is guarded by its own <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/28/seven-people-keys-worldwide-internet-security-web">Magnficent Seven</a>, a group of individuals working for <a href="https://www.icann.org/">ICANN</a>, the organization which originates the Internet's authentication keys. These keys are used in all top-level domains (aside, a domain is the suffix of your URL - .com, .org, and so on, and top-level domains are the ones you see most often), by every site, for verification services. The keys operate on a hierarchal model - they are generated by ICANN in a secure process, disseminated to organizations that maintain domain authentication registries (<a href="https://www.verisigninc.com/">VeriSign</a> is one of them), when then disseminate them to clients interested in maintaing the security of their online operations. This keyed authentication is backed up by other services such as <a href="https://www.whois.net/">Whois</a>, which is like the Yellow Pages (remember those?) for the Internet, providing information on the registered owners of domain names.
      </p>
      <p>
        This process isn't foolproof - it's still susceptible to user error - but these services are instrumental in making sure that when you talk to your bank online, you're really talking to your bank. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html">Nefarious activies</a> still abound on the Internet, but ICANN, the DNS and authentication services make sure that they are more like the crazy people on the street corner than real robbers and thieves. Most browsers also have built-in protections that alert you when you are visiting an insecure site - listen to them! It's a big wide world out there, but thanks to the work of these organizations you can share your data on the Internet with relative confidence - just watch out when you're in a shady neighborhood.
